# Python-Fit-Timer-Application
Final project - Created a Fit Timer application 
Each member of group was assigned to a specific layer of the Python Framework. These layers were Application Layer, Presentation Layer, and Data Access Layer. Once each member was completed with their layer, we were to create on application that a user would open the website, start the timer, end the timer, and the timer would save a post the time to a database. My layer was based on the application layer.
